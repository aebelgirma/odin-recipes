            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Burro Banana Fries are arguably the best substitute for potatoes for this dish. Unripe burro bananas hardly even taste like bananas at all and are so deceptive that it's guilt-free!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This side dish is common in countries close to the equator and East Africa as well.

                    As you prep your first green burro banana, you'll want to start planning trips to the nearest coastal city not just surrounded by palm trees.
